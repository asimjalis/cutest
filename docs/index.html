<h1>CuTest: C Unit Testing Framework</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>

CuTest is a unit testing library for the C language. It can be
used to do Extreme Programming and Test-First Development in the
C language. It's a fun and cute library that will make your
programming fun and productive.

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<ul>

<li> Lower Defects. The tests ensure that your code keeps working
as you make small changes in it.  

</li><li> Faster Debugging. The tests tell you which subroutine is
broken.  You avoid spending hours trying to figure out what's
broken.

</li><li> Development Speed. You trust your old code and can keep
adding to it without worrying about bad interactions. If there is
a bad interaction the tests will catch it.

</li><li> Permanent Bug Fixes. If every time a bug is reported you
write a quick test, you will guarantee that the bug never
reappears again.

</li><li> Fun. As your bug count drops you will begin to enjoy
programming like you've never done before. Running the tests
every few minutes and seeing them pass feels good.

</li></ul>

<h2> Features </h2>

<ul>

<li> Small. Consists of a single .c and .h file.

</li><li> Easy to Deploy. Just drop the two files into your source
tree.

</li><li> Highly Portable. Works with all major compilers on Windows
(Microsoft, Borland), Linux, Unix, PalmOS. 

</li><li> Open Source. You can extend it to add more functionality.
The source can be invaluable if you are trying to trace a test
failure.

</li><li> Cuteness. Of all the testing frameworks CuTest has the
cutest name :-)

</li></ul>


<h2>Licensing</h2>

CuTest is distributed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.html">zlib/libpng
license</a>. See license.txt in the distribution for text of license.  The
intent of the license is to: 

<ul>

<li> Keep the license as simple as possible
</li><li> Encourage the use of CuTest in both free and commercial applications and libraries
</li><li> Keep the source code together 
</li><li> Give credit to the CuTest contributors for their work

</li></ul>

If you find CuTest useful we would like to hear about it. 


<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p> For a detailed tutorial see README in the distribution.  This shows you how
to organize your tests and how to autogenerate the AllTests.c file from your
source files.

</p><p> To add unit testing to your C code the only files you need
are CuTest.c and CuTest.h. 

</p><p> CuTestTest.c and AllTests.c have been included to provide an
example of how to write unit tests and then how to aggregate them
into suites and into a single AllTests.c file. Suites allow you
to put unit tests for different parts of your code in different
files. AllTests.c combines all the suites and runs them. 

</p><p> You should not have to look inside CuTest.c.  Looking in
CuTestTest.c (for example usage) should be sufficient.
  
</p><p> After downloading the sources, run your compiler to create an
executable called AllTests.exe. For example, if you are using
Windows you would type:

</p><pre class="CONSOLE">cl AllTests.c CuTest.c CuTestTest.c
AllTests.exe
</pre>

<p> This will run all the unit tests associated with CuTest and
print the output on the console.

</p><p> For more details on how to use the library look at the README file included
with the distribution. 

</p><h2>Contribute</h2>

<p> We hope you CuTest saves you time and helps you produce high quality
software.

</p><p> If you find CuTest useful, let us know. Tell us what platform you are using
it on (Windows, Linux, etc), and what kinds of applications you are using it
with.

</p><p> If you would like to contribute documentation or tutorials to this project
please send e-mail.
